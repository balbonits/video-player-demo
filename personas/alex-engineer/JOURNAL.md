## **Day 1 - Foundation & Architecture (2024-09-18)**

### **Morning: Project Architecture Planning**
Working with John on understanding the dual Next.js implementation strategy. His 16+ years of experience shows in how he approaches architectural decisions - very methodical and focused on delivery timelines.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- **Primary Implementation:** Pages Router for fast development and proven performance
- **Secondary Implementation:** App Router for Next.js mastery demonstration
- **Rationale:** John correctly identified that slow hot reload would kill our 5-7 day timeline

**Technical Insights:**
- App Router TTFB penalty (80-130ms vs 14ms) is significant but manageable for video apps
- Video loading time dominates page performance anyway (1-3 seconds)
- For Smart TV applications, this penalty is acceptable given the visual impact

### **Afternoon: Documentation Structure Setup**
Created comprehensive documentation architecture with team. This level of organization shows enterprise thinking - exactly what FOX Corporation expects.

**Documentation Strategy:**
```
docs/           # Project-wide documentation
personas/       # Individual team member perspectives
```

This separation allows each persona to maintain their expertise while contributing to overall project knowledge.

### **Technical Architecture Decisions**

#### **Monorepo Structure Choice**
```typescript
// Decided on Turborepo for cross-platform code sharing
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-player-pages/     # Primary: Fast development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-player-app/       # Secondary: Modern patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ios-player/           # Native iOS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ android-player/       # Native Android
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roku-player/          # Smart TV (priority)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tizen-player/         # Samsung
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vizio-player/         # Vizio

packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player-core/          # Shared logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui-components/        # Cross-platform UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-utils/         # Common utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile-shared/        # Mobile-specific shared code
```

**Why This Structure:**
1. **Code Reuse:** Core video logic shared across platforms
2. **Platform Optimization:** Each app optimized for its target
3. **Development Speed:** Shared components reduce duplication
4. **Maintenance:** Single source of truth for business logic

#### **Technology Stack Rationale**

**Primary Stack (Pages Router):**
```typescript
// Proven, stable, fast development
Next.js 13/14 Pages Router
React 18
TypeScript (strict mode)
Redux Toolkit + Action Creators
HLS.js for streaming
Tailwind CSS
Jest + Testing Library + Playwright
```

**Why These Choices:**
- **Next.js Pages Router:** Proven performance, fast hot reload, stable patterns
- **Redux Toolkit:** Enterprise-grade state management, predictable patterns
- **TypeScript Strict:** Code quality, enterprise standards, fewer runtime errors
- **HLS.js:** Industry standard for adaptive streaming, excellent browser support

### **Performance Architecture Planning**

#### **Performance Budget Definition**
```typescript
interface PerformanceTargets {
  web: {
    initialLoad: '< 3000ms',    // Smart TV constraint
    videoStart: '< 1000ms',     // Time to first frame
    memoryUsage: '< 150MB',     // TV memory limits
    bundleSize: '< 500KB'       // Initial JavaScript
  },
  mobile: {
    appLaunch: '< 2000ms',      // iOS guidelines
    videoLoad: '< 1500ms',      // Mobile networks
    batteryDrain: '< 5%/hour'   // Background playback
  }
}
```

**Smart TV Optimization Strategy:**
1. **Bundle Splitting:** Route-based + component-based code splitting
2. **Memory Management:** Aggressive cleanup of video resources
3. **CPU Optimization:** RequestAnimationFrame throttling for 30fps UI on TV
4. **Network Optimization:** Intelligent buffering based on device capabilities

### **Evening: Redux Architecture Design**

#### **State Management Philosophy**
John's emphasis on Action Creators pattern is spot-on for demonstrating enterprise patterns. Redux Toolkit + Action Creators shows:
1. **Predictable State Updates:** Every state change goes through action creators
2. **Debugging Capabilities:** Time-travel debugging, action replay
3. **Testing Simplicity:** Easy to mock actions and test reducers
4. **Team Collaboration:** Clear contracts between components and state

#### **Store Architecture**
```typescript
interface RootState {
  player: PlayerState          // Video playback control
  video: VideoState           // Content metadata and sources
  ui: UIState                 // Interface state, navigation mode
  accessibility: A11yState   // User preferences, caption settings
  analytics: AnalyticsState   // Performance tracking, usage metrics
  platform: PlatformState    // Device-specific optimizations
}
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Single Source of Truth:** All video state managed centrally
- **Immutable Updates:** Redux Toolkit's Immer for safe mutations
- **Async Handling:** Thunks for complex video operations
- **Persistence:** User preferences saved across sessions

## **Technical Concerns & Solutions**

### **HLS Streaming Complexity**
**Challenge:** Cross-browser HLS support varies significantly
**Solution:**
```typescript
// Progressive enhancement approach
const initializePlayer = (videoElement: HTMLVideoElement, src: string) => {
  if (Hls.isSupported()) {
    // Use HLS.js for browsers without native HLS
    const hls = new Hls(optimizedConfig)
    hls.loadSource(src)
    hls.attachMedia(videoElement)
    return hls
  } else if (videoElement.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {
    // Safari has native HLS support
    videoElement.src = src
    return null
  } else {
    // Fallback to MP4
    videoElement.src = convertToMP4Fallback(src)
    return null
  }
}
```

### **Smart TV Performance Challenges**
**Challenge:** Limited hardware capabilities, different input methods
**Solutions:**
1. **Memory Management:** Aggressive resource cleanup
2. **Focus Management:** Spatial navigation for D-pad controls
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time metrics for optimization
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Reduced features on constrained devices

### **Cross-Platform State Synchronization**
**Challenge:** Maintaining consistent state across web, mobile, TV
**Solution:** Shared Redux logic with platform-specific adapters
```typescript
// Platform-specific middleware
const platformMiddleware = (platform: Platform) => (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  // Apply platform-specific transformations
  const adaptedAction = adaptActionForPlatform(action, platform)
  return next(adaptedAction)
}
```

## **Learning Insights**

### **Next.js Evolution Understanding**
Working with both Pages and App Router side-by-side is revealing:

**Pages Router Strengths:**
- Mature ecosystem, predictable patterns
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Easy mental model for developers with SPA background
- Fast development iteration

**App Router Opportunities:**
- Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
- Better SEO with dynamic metadata generation
- Streaming UI improves perceived performance
- Future-proofing for Next.js evolution

### **Video Streaming Architecture Lessons**
1. **User Experience First:** Video loading time matters more than framework overhead
2. **Progressive Enhancement:** Always have fallbacks for different capabilities
3. **Resource Management:** Video applications are memory-intensive
4. **Cross-Platform Complexity:** Each platform has unique constraints and opportunities

## **Tomorrow's Priorities**

### **Day 2 Focus: Project Setup & Core Implementation**
1. **Initialize Projects:** Set up both Pages and App Router projects
2. **Configure TypeScript:** Strict mode configuration for enterprise quality
3. **Redux Setup:** Store configuration with Action Creators pattern
4. **Basic Video Player:** Core HTML5 video element with controls

### **Technical Tasks:**
