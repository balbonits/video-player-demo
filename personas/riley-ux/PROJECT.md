## **Video Player Wireframing Strategy**

### **Primary Design Deliverables Using Superdesign**

#### **1. Desktop Video Player Interface**
**Superdesign Prompt Strategy:**
```
"Generate desktop video player wireframe with:
- 16:9 aspect ratio video container (1280x720 recommended)
- Centered play button overlay (80px) with accessibility focus ring
- Bottom control bar (60px height) with gradient background
- Controls: play/pause, volume slider, progress bar, quality selector, settings, fullscreen
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance: 4.5:1 contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels
- Smart TV optimization: 64px buttons, clear focus indicators, D-pad navigation
- Redux integration points for state management
- TypeScript interface specifications"
```

**Expected Superdesign Output:**
- Complete wireframe with measurements
- Component specifications with TypeScript interfaces
- Accessibility implementation details
- CSS/Tailwind styling specifications
- Testing requirements for 90% coverage

#### **2. Mobile Video Player Interface**
**Superdesign Prompt Strategy:**
```
"Create mobile video player wireframe for 375x812 viewport:
- Portrait-optimized video container with letterboxing
- Large touch targets (56px minimum) for mobile accessibility
- Touch gesture support: tap play/pause, swipe seek, pinch zoom
- Bottom control overlay with essential controls only
- Settings as bottom sheet modal
- iOS and Android platform considerations
- Touch-friendly progress bar (12px height)
- Picture-in-Picture button positioning"
```

#### **3. Smart TV Interface**
**Superdesign Prompt Strategy:**
```
"Design Smart TV video player for 1920x1080 with TV-safe margins:
- 48px horizontal margins, 27px vertical margins for TV safe area
- Large buttons (80px) optimized for D-pad navigation
- Spatial navigation logic: left/right between controls, up/down for video/settings
- Enhanced focus indicators: 4px outline + scale transform
- TV viewing distance typography (24px minimum)
- Remote control button mapping visualization
- Performance optimized for TV hardware constraints"
```

#### **4. Settings Panel Comprehensive Design**
**Superdesign Prompt Strategy:**
```
"Generate video player settings panel with:
- Caption customization: font size, color, background, position
- Quality selection: auto, 1080p, 720p, 480p with bandwidth indicators
- Accessibility options: high contrast, reduced motion, screen reader mode
- Audio settings: track selection, volume boost
- Performance settings: power save mode, quality priority
- Platform-specific adaptations for desktop/mobile/TV
- Modal overlay with backdrop blur and focus trap"
```
