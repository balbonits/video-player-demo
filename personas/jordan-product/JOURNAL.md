### **User Story Development**

#### **Epic 1: Core Video Playback**
```gherkin
Feature: Basic Video Playback
  As a user viewing the video player demo
  I want to watch video content with standard controls
  So that I can evaluate the player's core functionality

  Scenario: Video Loading and Playback
    Given I navigate to the video player demo
    When the page loads
    Then I should see a video player with a prominent play button
    And the video should load within 3 seconds
    And I should be able to click play to start playback

  Scenario: Video Controls
    Given I have a video loaded in the player
    When I interact with the controls
    Then I should be able to play, pause, seek, and adjust volume
    And all controls should be clearly labeled and accessible
    And the controls should work with both mouse and keyboard
```

#### **Epic 2: Smart TV Experience**
```gherkin
Feature: Smart TV Navigation
  As a Smart TV user with a remote control
  I want to navigate the video player using arrow keys
  So that I can control playback without a mouse or touch screen

  Scenario: Remote Control Navigation
    Given I am using the video player on a Smart TV
    When I press the arrow keys on my remote
    Then the focus should move logically between controls
    And focused elements should be clearly highlighted
    And I should be able to activate controls with the Enter key

  Scenario: Performance on TV Hardware
    Given I am using the video player on Smart TV hardware
    When I interact with the player
    Then the interface should respond within 200ms
    And video playback should be smooth without stuttering
    And the app should use less than 150MB of memory
```

#### **Epic 3: Accessibility Excellence**
```gherkin
Feature: Accessibility Compliance
  As a user with disabilities
  I want to use all video player features with assistive technology
  So that I can enjoy video content independently

  Scenario: Screen Reader Support
    Given I am using a screen reader
    When I navigate the video player
    Then all controls should be properly labeled
    And state changes should be announced
    And I should be able to access all functionality

  Scenario: Keyboard-Only Operation
    Given I can only use a keyboard for input
    When I interact with the video player
    Then I should be able to reach all interactive elements via Tab
    And focus indicators should be clearly visible
    And I should be able to complete all tasks using only keyboard
```
