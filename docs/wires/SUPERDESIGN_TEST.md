## **MCP Server Status Verification**

### **Installed and Connected:**
```bash
$ claude mcp list
superdesign: /tmp/superdesign-mcp/dist/index.js  - âœ“ Connected
```

### **Available Superdesign Tools (Per Documentation):**
1. **`superdesign_generate`** - Generate design specifications
2. **`superdesign_iterate`** - Improve existing designs
3. **`superdesign_extract_system`** - Extract design systems from images

## **Test 1: Video Player Component Generation**

**Riley (UX):** *"Let me test Superdesign's component generation for our video player:"*

### **Test Prompt:**
"Generate a comprehensive React TypeScript video player component with:
- HLS streaming support
- Smart TV D-pad navigation
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Redux state management integration
- Cross-platform responsive design
- 90% test coverage specifications"

### **Expected Superdesign Output:**
- Complete React component specification
- TypeScript interfaces and props
- Accessibility implementation details
- Testing requirements and scenarios
- Styling specifications with Tailwind CSS
- Cross-platform adaptations

## **Verification Note**

**Morgan (Team Lead):** *"The MCP server is connected, but the specific tool names might be different from the documentation. This is common with MCP servers. The tools are available, we just need to identify the correct function names."*

**Next Steps:**
1. Test Superdesign functionality through natural language
2. Verify component generation works
3. Document actual tool capabilities
4. Proceed with video player design generation

**Ready to test Superdesign's actual capabilities, John?**
