## **Day 1 - Project Foundation & Team Formation (2024-09-18)**

### **Initial Project Kickoff - Morning Session**

#### **Strategic Context Established**
**John's Background & Goals:**
- 16+ years frontend development experience
- Former FOX Digital Media contractor (2012-2019, 2020-2022)
- Currently seeking employment, contract ended August 2024
- Target: FOX Corporation Senior Web/JavaScript Engineer position
- Timeline: 5-7 days for comprehensive demo
- Goal: Impress hiring manager with streaming video + Smart TV expertise

#### **Project Vision Discussion**
**John's Original Concept:**
"Modern video player exploring accessibility features that were 'nice to haves' during my FOX tenure"

**Team Refinement:**
- **Jordan (Product):** Aligned with FOX Corporation job posting requirements
- **Alex (Engineer):** Emphasized Smart TV platform experience as differentiator
- **Sam (QA):** Highlighted accessibility compliance as competitive advantage
- **Riley (UX):** Focused on inclusive design demonstrating WCAG expertise
- **Morgan (Team Lead):** Coordinated strategy around career advancement goals

#### **Technology Stack Decisions**

**Major Decision 1: Pages Router vs App Router**
- **Initial Proposal:** App Router for cutting-edge demonstration
- **Alex's Concern:** "App Router hot reload issues would kill our 5-7 day timeline"
- **John's Response:** "Slower development (hot reload) already invalidates my suggestion"
- **Team Decision:** Dual implementation - Pages Router (primary), App Router (secondary)
- **Rationale:** Pages Router for reliable development, App Router for Next.js mastery showcase

**Major Decision 2: State Management**
- **John's Request:** "Add Redux for state management, we'll use Action Creators pattern"
- **Team Consensus:** Redux Toolkit + Action Creators demonstrates enterprise patterns
- **Alex's Implementation:** Store architecture with persistence for user preferences
- **Sam's Integration:** Redux testing strategy with 90% coverage requirement

**Major Decision 3: Cross-Platform Scope**
- **John's Specification:** "Web base + native OTT implementations for Tizen, Vizio, & Roku"
- **Scope Expansion:** Added iOS and Android native implementations
- **Platform Priority:** Roku gets "as much attention as possible"
- **Technical Approach:** Shared core logic with platform-specific optimizations

#### **Quality Standards Discussion**

**Testing Coverage Evolution:**
- **Initial Standard:** 80% test coverage
- **John's Revision:** "Test coverage: set to 90%+"
- **Sam's Response:** Updated all quality gates to 90% overall, 95% critical components
- **Impact Assessment:** +20% development time, significant quality improvement
- **Team Agreement:** Higher standard demonstrates enterprise discipline

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- **John's Priority:** "Accessibility-first - High contrast, clear focus states, readable fonts"
- **Riley's Implementation:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- **Sam's Integration:** Comprehensive accessibility testing automation
- **Business Value:** Connects to John's ADP/TBN accessibility experience

- **Jordan (Product):** Analyzed competitive landscape and tool capabilities

**Tool Evaluation Results:**
1. **Visily.ai:** Free forever plan, but no CLI/API integration
2. **Frame0 MCP:** Good wireframing, requires local app installation
3. **Superdesign MCP:** Complete design-to-code workflow, no API keys required

**Final Decision:**
- **John's Choice:** "Let's use Superdesign, solely"
- **Riley's Ownership:** Complete responsibility for Superdesign mastery
