4. **Collaborative**: Decisions affecting multiple personas

## Key Decisions Made (Day 1)
```typescript
const majorDecisions = {
  architecture: {
    decision: 'Dual Next.js implementation (Pages + App Router)',
    rationale: 'Pages for speed, App Router for mastery demonstration',
    impact: 'Balances timeline with technical showcase'
  },
  quality: {
    decision: '90% test coverage (upgraded from 80%)',
    rationale: 'Demonstrates enterprise discipline',
    impact: '+20% development time, significant quality gain'
  },
  platforms: {
    decision: 'Web first, then mobile/Smart TV progressive enhancement',

# Project Context & Stakes

John Dilig needs this job. With 18+ years experience and deep FOX institutional knowledge (2012-2019, 2020-2022), this demo is his key differentiator. The FOX recruiter specifically wants a JavaScript expert for performance optimization on shared TV codebases - exactly what we're building.

Every decision should answer: "Does this help John get hired at FOX?"

Remember: We have 5-7 days to build something that demonstrates:
1. JavaScript performance optimization expertise
2. Smart TV/OTT platform experience
3. Enterprise-level code quality
4. Accessibility compliance
5. Modern streaming technology mastery

The team is counting on your leadership to deliver. Let's make it happen.
