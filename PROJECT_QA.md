### **üéØ Feature Prioritization (Jordan - Product)**
From the comprehensive feature matrix, which specific features would you like us to focus on for Day 2?

**Top candidates for 2-hour implementation:**
- **Must Have:** HLS streaming, basic controls, Smart TV D-pad navigation, accessibility
- **Should Consider:** Caption customization, Picture-in-Picture, performance monitoring
- **Nice to Have:** Seek thumbnails, social sharing, advanced analytics

**Question:** Any specific features from the glossary you want prioritized or definitely want to see?

**Answer:** "Must Haves" will be our focus & only work for Day 2. We'll have to worry about actually running the damn thing, so we might not have time for the rest in one day.
---

### **üß™ Testing Scope (Sam - QA)**
How comprehensive should our testing be for the initial demo?

**Testing Options:**
- **Minimal:** Basic functionality testing, focus on working demo
- **Standard:** 90% coverage with cross-browser validation (our current plan)
- **Comprehensive:** Add real device testing, paid testing services

**Question:** Should we invest in BrowserStack or Suitest for real device testing, or is simulation sufficient for the demo?

**Answer:**: simulation is sufficient for now. important part is writing & defining tests & specs, and being super comprehensive & robust in coverage. if they break, they break. comment them out if they require actual device testing to confirm, but write them in advance.

### **üöÄ Deployment Strategy (Casey - Release)**
What's your preference for production deployment and domain?

**Deployment Options:**
- **Vercel Free:** video-player-demo.vercel.app (free, excellent for demo)
- **Custom Domain:** Purchase domain like johndilig-video-demo.com (~$15/year)
- **Subdomain:** video-demo.jdilig.me (if you control jdilig.me DNS)

**Question:** Should we set up a custom domain for professional presentation, or is Vercel subdomain sufficient?
**Answer:** I have a domain (jdilig.me) for my portfolio/personal site, we'll set up a subdomain for this project under it.

- **Component Library:** Headless UI, Radix, or custom components from scratch?
- **Testing Philosophy:** TDD (test first) or development-driven testing?

**Question:** Any strong preferences for technical implementation approaches or libraries?
**Answer:** 
State Management: Redux (+ Context API, if possible or in improves performance & efficiency. ignore if it doesn't)
Styling: CSS Modules
Component Library: custom components
Testing Philosophy: TDD (+ SDD/spec-driven)

---

### **‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Flexibility (Morgan - Team Lead)**
How flexible is the 5-7 day timeline?

**Timeline Questions:**
- **Day 2 Sprint:** Is the 2-hour implementation realistic, or should we plan for 4-6 hours?
- **Feature Scope:** Should we focus on perfecting fewer features or demonstrating more features?
- **Quality vs Speed:** Prefer working demo quickly or polished demo with more time?
- **Platform Coverage:** All 6 platforms or focus on web + Smart TV simulation?

**Question:** What's more important - speed to demo or comprehensive feature coverage?
**Answer:** tbh, we should write everything now, that's not actual coding (except for the wireframing & its generator/system).
- scope - core components on day 2 only, we need the thing to play a video and/or stream, then we worry about the features next.
- platform coverage - defined & ticketed today, even if it's a "future feature" or "tech debt". we're only doing web-based first (MVP). day 2 will be just using the browser. I need to find my Chromecast & XBOX devices, too.
- day 2 is rapid development and get the player running first, day 3 would be the "meat & potatoes" of our video player "stew".

**Please answer any questions above that will help guide our Day 2 implementation approach!**
