## **Day 1 - Project Kickoff & Team Coordination (2024-09-18)**

### **Morning: Project Vision Alignment**
Led initial kickoff with John and coordinated team personas to establish clear project vision and success criteria. This project is unique - it's both a technical demonstration and a strategic career investment with a hard deadline driven by John's job application timeline.

**Strategic Context Established:**
- **Primary Goal:** Secure FOX Corporation Senior Web/JavaScript Engineer position
- **Timeline:** 5-7 days for comprehensive demo
- **Approach:** Dual Next.js implementation (Pages + App Router)
- **Quality Standard:** Enterprise-level code demonstrating 16+ years of experience

### **Team Formation & Role Clarity**

#### **Team Composition & Responsibilities**
- **Alex (Engineer):** Technical implementation, architecture decisions, performance optimization
- **Sam (QA):** Testing strategy, accessibility compliance, quality assurance
- **Jordan (Product):** Requirements, user stories, competitive analysis, stakeholder needs
- **Casey (Release):** CI/CD, deployment, release management, DevOps
- **Riley (UX):** Design system, accessibility, user experience, wireframes
- **Morgan (Team Lead):** Coordination, decisions, documentation, reporting to John

#### **Communication Protocols Established**
- **Daily standups:** Via documentation updates in persona journals
- **Decision escalation:** Complex decisions go through me to John
- **Documentation:** Each persona maintains their own project context
- **Cross-functional collaboration:** Explicitly defined in persona descriptions

### **Project Scope & Architecture Decisions**

#### **Major Architectural Decision: Dual Implementation**
**Decision:** Implement both Pages Router (primary) and App Router (secondary)
**Rationale:**
- Pages Router: Fast development, proven performance, working demo on time
- App Router: Next.js mastery demonstration, competitive advantage

**Team Input:**
- **Alex:** Correctly identified App Router hot reload issues would impact timeline
- **Sam:** Concerned about testing complexity across both implementations
- **Jordan:** Supports dual approach for maximum competitive advantage
- **Casey:** Can handle dual deployment pipeline
- **Riley:** Will adapt designs for both routing approaches

#### **Technology Stack Decisions**
```typescript
// Final technology decisions
const technologyDecisions = {
  frontend: 'Next.js 14 (Pages + App Router)',
  language: 'TypeScript (strict mode)',
  stateManagement: 'Redux Toolkit + Action Creators',
  styling: 'Tailwind CSS',
  videoStreaming: 'HLS.js',
  testing: 'Jest + Testing Library + Playwright + Axe',
  deployment: 'Vercel',
  monorepo: 'Turborepo'
}
```

**Decision Process:** Each team member provided input based on their expertise, I synthesized recommendations, and we aligned on enterprise-quality choices that demonstrate professional development practices.

### **Risk Assessment & Mitigation Planning**

#### **High-Priority Risks Identified**
1. **Timeline Risk:** 5-7 days is aggressive for comprehensive demo
   - **Mitigation:** Pages Router first (proven fast development), App Router as stretch goal
   - **Owner:** Morgan (timeline management), Alex (technical execution)

2. **Complexity Risk:** Cross-platform implementation across 6 platforms
   - **Mitigation:** Web first, mobile/TV as progressive enhancement
   - **Owner:** Alex (technical architecture), Morgan (scope management)

3. **Quality Risk:** Maintaining enterprise standards under time pressure
   - **Mitigation:** TDD approach, automated quality gates, Sam's testing strategy
   - **Owner:** Sam (quality assurance), Morgan (quality standards enforcement)

4. **Scope Creep Risk:** Feature expansion beyond MVP needs
   - **Mitigation:** Clear MoSCoW prioritization from Jordan, regular scope reviews
   - **Owner:** Jordan (product scope), Morgan (scope enforcement)

### **Documentation Strategy Implementation**

#### **Documentation Architecture Created**

```

**Documentation Philosophy:** Each persona maintains their own perspective while contributing to overall project knowledge. This approach:
1. **Preserves expertise:** Each role documents from their professional viewpoint
2. **Enables collaboration:** Cross-references between personas create comprehensive view
3. **Demonstrates process:** Shows enterprise-level documentation practices
4. **Supports learning:** John can see different professional perspectives on same project

### **Stakeholder Management**

#### **Primary Stakeholder: John Dilig**
**Relationship:** Direct report, final decision authority
**Communication:** Regular updates on progress, escalation of major decisions
**Success Criteria:** FOX job acquisition, professional development, portfolio enhancement

**Weekly Reporting Structure:**
- **Monday:** Week planning and priority setting
- **Wednesday:** Mid-week progress check and risk assessment
- **Friday:** Week wrap-up and next week preparation
- **Ad-hoc:** Major decisions, blockers, scope changes

#### **Secondary Stakeholder: FOX Corporation (Proxy)**
**Relationship:** Indirect stakeholder through John's application
**Requirements:** Evidence of Smart TV expertise, HLS streaming, accessibility compliance
**Demonstration Needs:** Enterprise development practices, modern React patterns, performance optimization

### **Agile Process Implementation**

#### **Modified Agile for 5-7 Day Sprint**
```typescript
// Agile adaptation for compressed timeline
const agileProcess = {
  sprintLength: '5-7 days (entire project)',
  dailyStandups: 'Via persona journal updates',
  planningSession: 'Day 1 (today)',
  reviewSession: 'Day 6-7',
  retrospectiveSession: 'Post-deployment',

  artifacts: {
    productBacklog: 'Jordan maintains in PROJECT_QA.md',
    sprintBacklog: 'Morgan maintains in plans/ directory',
    incrementDefinition: 'Working demo ready for FOX interview',
    velocityTracking: 'Feature completion rate vs. timeline'
  }
}
```

#### **Team Velocity Estimation**
Based on team expertise and timeline:
- **Alex (Engineer):** High velocity on React/TypeScript, medium on video streaming
- **Sam (QA):** High velocity on testing automation, medium on accessibility validation
- **Jordan (Product):** High velocity on requirements, research, competitive analysis
- **Casey (Release):** High velocity on DevOps, medium on multi-platform deployment
- **Riley (UX):** High velocity on design systems, medium on Smart TV UX patterns

**Estimated Capacity:** 80% of ideal velocity due to compressed timeline and learning curve

    level2: 'Cross-functional team consultation',
    level3: 'Team lead (Morgan) decision',
    level4: 'Escalation to John for strategic decisions'
  },

  examples: {
    level1: 'Component implementation details, test case design',
    level2: 'API design, user experience flows, performance targets',
    level3: 'Technology stack changes, scope adjustments, timeline modifications',
    level4: 'Project pivot, major feature cuts, external dependency decisions'
  }
}
```

### **Communication Effectiveness**
