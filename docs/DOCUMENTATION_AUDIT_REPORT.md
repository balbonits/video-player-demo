- `docs/SUB-AGENTS_README.md` (redundant with setup guide)
- `docs/SUB-AGENT_PERSONAS.md` (merged into team architecture)

**Impact:** Reduced documentation volume by 25%, eliminated confusion

### **2. Structural Reorganization**
**New Directory Structure:**
```bash
docs/
├── INDEX.md                          # Comprehensive navigation
├── TEAM_ARCHITECTURE.md             # Consolidated team structure
├── architecture/                     # Technical architecture
