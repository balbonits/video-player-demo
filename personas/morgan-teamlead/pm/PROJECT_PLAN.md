```

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. **Foundation â†’ Core Development:** Architecture decisions must be complete before implementation
2. **Core Development â†’ Enhancement:** Basic functionality required before advanced features
3. **Enhancement â†’ Cross-Platform:** Accessibility and performance baselines needed first
4. **Cross-Platform â†’ Deployment:** All platforms must be functional before production
