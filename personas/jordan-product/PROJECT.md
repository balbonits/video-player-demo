## **Product Requirements Specification**

### **Functional Requirements (Epic Level)**

#### **Epic 1: Core Video Playback**
```gherkin
Feature: HLS Video Streaming
  As a user viewing video content
  I want reliable adaptive streaming playback
  So that I can watch videos smoothly regardless of network conditions

  Background:
    Given I am on a video player demo page
    And the page has loaded completely
    And my network connection is stable

  Scenario: Automatic Quality Selection
    When the video starts playing
    Then the player should automatically select optimal quality
    And quality should adapt based on network bandwidth
    And I should see a quality indicator

  Scenario: Manual Quality Override
    Given the video is playing with automatic quality
    When I open the settings menu
    And I select a specific quality (1080p, 720p, 480p)
    Then the video should switch to the selected quality
    And the setting should persist for future videos

  Scenario: Error Recovery
    Given the video is playing normally
    When a network error occurs
    Then the player should attempt to recover automatically
    And I should see an appropriate error message if recovery fails
    And I should have an option to retry playback
```

#### **Epic 2: Smart TV Navigation**
```gherkin
Feature: Smart TV Remote Control
  As a Smart TV user with a remote control
  I want to navigate and control the video player using arrow keys
  So that I can enjoy content from my couch without additional devices

  Background:
    Given I am using a Smart TV or TV-connected device
    And I have a standard TV remote control
    And the video player is displayed on the TV

  Scenario: Basic Navigation
    When I press the Tab key or directional pad
    Then focus should move to the first interactive element
    And focused elements should be clearly highlighted
    And I should see navigation hints for available actions

  Scenario: Control Activation
    Given I have focused on a control element
    When I press Enter or OK on my remote
    Then the control should activate immediately
    And any state changes should be visually apparent
    And focus should remain on logical next element

  Scenario: Spatial Navigation
    Given I am focused on the play button
    When I press the right arrow key
    Then focus should move to the volume control
    When I press the down arrow key
    Then focus should move to the settings button
    And navigation should follow intuitive spatial layout
```

#### **Epic 3: Accessibility Excellence**
```gherkin
Feature: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
  As a user with disabilities
  I want to access all video player functionality
  So that I can enjoy content independently using assistive technology

  Background:
    Given I am using assistive technology (screen reader, keyboard only, etc.)
    And I have specific accessibility needs
    And the video player is fully loaded

  Scenario: Screen Reader Compatibility
    Given I am using a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
    When I navigate the video player
    Then all controls should be properly labeled
    And state changes should be announced clearly
    And video content should be accessible via audio description

  Scenario: Keyboard-Only Operation
    Given I can only use keyboard input
    When I interact with the video player
    Then all functionality should be accessible via keyboard
    And tab order should be logical and complete
    And focus indicators should be clearly visible

  Scenario: Caption Customization
    Given I need customized captions for readability
    When I access caption settings
    Then I should be able to adjust font size, color, and position
    And settings should apply immediately to current video
    And preferences should persist across sessions
```
